# TikTok Application URLs - HTTPS Fix

## ðŸš¨ **The Problem:**
TikTok requires HTTPS URLs but you were using `http://localhost:3000`

## âœ… **The Solution:**

### **For TikTok Application Form, Use These URLs:**

```
Terms of Service URL: https://kylife.ca/terms
Privacy Policy URL: https://kylife.ca/privacy
Web/Desktop URL: https://kylife.ca
Redirect URI: https://kylife.ca/api/auth/callback/tiktok
```

## ðŸš€ **Quick Deploy to Get HTTPS URLs:**

1. **Deploy to Vercel first** (we'll do this now)
2. **Use production URLs** in TikTok application
3. **Create demo video** using deployed site

### **Deploy Command:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

This will give you:
- âœ… HTTPS URLs that TikTok accepts
- âœ… Professional domain (kylife.ca)
- âœ… Real deployment for demo video

## ðŸ“‹ **Updated Application Form:**

**App Details:**
```
App Name: Life Activity Tracker
