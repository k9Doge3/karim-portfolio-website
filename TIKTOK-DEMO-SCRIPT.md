## üé¨ Recording Tips

### Technical Setup:
1. **Use screen recording software** (OBS, Camtasia, or built-in screen record)
2. **Record at 1080p** for clarity
3. **Include cursor highlights** to show interactions
4. **Record browser with kylife.ca domain clearly visible**

### Before Recording:
1. **Clear browser cache** for clean demo
2. **Close unnecessary tabs** for focus
3. **Ensure stable internet** for smooth API calls
4. **Test all functionality** beforehand

### During Recording:
1. **Speak clearly** and at moderate pace
2. **Move cursor deliberately** to show interactions
3. **Pause briefly** on key elements
4. **Keep domain visible** in address bar

### Sandbox Environment Note:
Since this is initial approval, you'll need to:
1. **Use TikTok's sandbox environment** for the demo
2. **Show test data** rather than live data
3. **Mention this is sandbox mode** in narration
4. **Demonstrate the same functionality** that will work in production

## üîß Quick Demo Setup

If you need to record now with mock data:

1. **Modify TikTok component** to show "DEMO MODE" overlay
2. **Use placeholder data** that represents real functionality
3. **Add comments** in narration about sandbox usage
4. **Show the API integration points** clearly
