# TikTok API Application Setup - Correct Configuration

## üö® **IMPORTANT: You Need Display API (Not Listed in Your Options)**

The products you're seeing are NOT what you need for your portfolio. You're missing the **Display API** which is the correct product for displaying TikTok content on websites.

## ‚ùå **Do NOT Add These Products:**

### ‚ùå Login Kit
- **Purpose:** User authentication with TikTok accounts
- **Why you don't need it:** Your portfolio doesn't require visitors to log in

### ‚ùå Share Kit  
- **Purpose:** Share content FROM your website TO TikTok
- **Why you don't need it:** You're displaying content, not sharing content to TikTok

### ‚ùå Content Posting API
- **Purpose:** Upload videos to TikTok from your app
- **Why you don't need it:** You're showing existing content, not creating new posts

### ‚ùå Webhooks
- **Purpose:** Real-time notifications from TikTok
- **Why you don't need it:** Simple API refresh is sufficient for portfolio display

### ‚ùå Data Portability API
- **Purpose:** Transfer TikTok data (EEA/UK only)
- **Why you don't need it:** Only for specific regions and data migration

## ‚úÖ **What You Actually Need: Display API**

### üîç **How to Find Display API:**

1. **Look for "Display API"** in the products list
2. **Alternative names it might be called:**
   - "Basic Display API"
   - "Public Content API"
   - "Read-only API"
   - "Profile Display"

3. **If you can't find Display API:**
   - Look for a "View All Products" or "More Products" button
   - Check if there's a different category for "Display" or "Read-only" APIs
   - Sometimes it's under "Content APIs" or "Profile APIs"

## üéØ **Next Steps:**

1. **STOP** - Don't add any of the products you listed
2. **FIND** Display API in the product list
3. **SELECT** Display API only
4. **ADD** the correct scopes (user.info.basic, video.list)
5. **SUBMIT** with the corrected information

## üîç **If Display API is Missing:**

Some TikTok developer portals organize products differently. Look for:

- "Read-only APIs" 
- "Public Content Access"
- Or contact TikTok Developer Support

**Don't proceed without Display API - the other products won't work for your portfolio!**
